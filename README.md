This is a port of https://pokedex-react-mui.netlify.app/ (can find repo top right there) to svelte, specifically svelte kit. All the data comes from https://pokeapi.co/ and the app design comes from https://github.com/s1varam. There are a number of CSS issues in _this_ codebase and an uncounted number of improvements waiting to be madeâ€“pull requests are awesome!
